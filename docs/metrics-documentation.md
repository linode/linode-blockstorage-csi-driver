## Grafana Dashboard Documentation: **CSI Driver Metrics**

### 1. **Introduction**
This Grafana dashboard provides an in-depth view of the CSI Driver operations for Linode Block Storage, with real-time data on volume creation, deletion, publication, and expansion. It also tracks persistent volume claims and potential runtime errors. The data is sourced from Prometheus, making it ideal for monitoring and diagnosing issues with CSI Driver operations.

### 2. **Dashboard Structure**
The dashboard is divided into several panels. Each panel focuses on a different aspect of CSI Driver operations, including Create/Delete/Publish Volume requests, runtime operation errors, and Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) events.

### 3. **Key Metrics and Visualizations with Graphs**

---

##### **Key points to know in-order to understand the graphs**:

- The y-axis is scaled by 1000. To get the correct number, multiply the decimal by 1000.
- The graphs which show total time taken, show time taken in `seconds`.
- The example graphs are plotted over a period of 48 hours, due to which the x-axis contains date and time.
- The spikes you see happened during e2e tests.
